## Project DIGITS: NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip

*  The GB10 Superchip combines a Blackwell GPU with a Grace CPU featuring **20 Arm-based cores**, developed in collaboration with MediaTek.
* **1 petaflop** of performance at **FP4 precision** (A petaflop is 1,000 trillion calculations per second)
* **128GB** of unified, coherent memory and up to **4TB** of NVMe storage
* Developers can run up to **200-billion-parameter large language models**
* Using **NVIDIA ConnectX®** networking, two Project DIGITS AI supercomputers can be linked to run up to **405-billion-parameter models**
* **Linux-based NVIDIA DGX OS**, deploy them seamlessly on **NVIDIA DGX Cloud**
* Project DIGITS will be available in May 2025 from NVIDIA and top partners, starting at **$3,000**

## NVIDIA Grace CPU
Green Light: NVIDIA Grace CPU Paves Fast Lane to Energy-Efficient Computing for Every Data Center
* https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-cpu-energy-efficiency/
* In tests of real workloads, the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip scored **2x performance gains** over x86 processors at the **same power envelope** across major data center CPU applications.
* It uses an ultra-fast fabric to connect **72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores in a single die** that sports 3.2 terabytes per second in fabric bisection bandwidth, a standard measure of throughput.
* Then it connects two of those dies in a superchip  package with the NVIDIA **NVLink-C2C interconnect**, delivering 900 GB/s of bandwidth.

* Nvidia’s “Grace” Arm CPU Holds Its Own Against X86 For HPC
    * https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/02/06/nvidias-grace-arm-cpu-holds-its-own-against-x86-for-hpc/
    * That yields a total of **144 Arm Neoverse “Demeter” V2 cores** with the **Armv9 architecture**, and 1 TB of physical memory with 1.1 TB/sec of peak theoretical bandwidth
