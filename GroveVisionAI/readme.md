## Seeed Studio Modbus RS485 Vision AI Camera

https://www.seeedstudio.com/RS485-Vision-AI-Camera-p-6346.html

* Powerful Visual AI Processing Capability: local inference up to 480*480 10FPS with WiseEye2 HX6538 processor featuring dual-core Arm Cortex-M55 and integrated Arm Ethos-U55 neural network unit
* Edge Computing for High Data Security: local image inference, send only the final result, suitable for applications requiring limited data transmission and high data privacy.
* Multi-Functional AI Models: shipped with 3 built-in models of human detection, people count, and meter reading, and it also easy to deploy public AI models or train customized AI models on SenseCraft AI with a few clicks. Support TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.
* Multi-Transmission Protocols: Supports transmitting inference results via standard RS485 protocol; connect with SenseCAP S2100/ 4G Sensor Hub DTU to get the results via LoRaWAN or 4G. Also supports transmiting keyframes via Wi-Fi.
* Dust and Water Resistance: IP66-rated protection ensures stable long-term deployment in indoor and outdoor environments.
* Model Management via SenseCraft App: Configure and switch between pre-installed AI models with just a few taps. Easily adjust Model Confidence Thresholds to optimize performance for your specific use case.
